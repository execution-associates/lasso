# Run the Vite dev server inside this worktree's dev container, wired to the
# lasso backend that is still running on the host.
#
#   usage: container-dev-web.sh <backend-port-on-host> <tailnet-dns-name>
#
# The backend deliberately stays on titan: it drives herdr, spawns panes and
# reads the real daemon socket, none of which belongs in a container. Only Vite
# moves, which is the half that executes third-party code — and it does so
# continuously, not just at install time, so it is if anything the more
# important half to isolate.
#
# Two incus proxy devices carry the traffic, declared in scripts/isb/dev-web.yaml
# (read it for the direction and binding of each). They are point-to-point TCP
# forwards for exactly one port each, which is why this does NOT need
# `--network host` — the container keeps its own network namespace.
#
# Inside the container Vite is always on 5173: a fresh network namespace has
# nothing else in it, so --strictPort is safe and the port is predictable. It is
# the HOST side that has to give way, so isb publishes it on the first free
# host loopback port from 5173 (`search`), the way the backend already bumps
# from 8190. Several dev instances run at once because each worktree has its own
# container (scripts/container.sh).
#
# The tailnet reaches Vite only over HTTPS: `tailscale serve` terminates TLS
# with the machine's ts.net certificate on the SAME port number on the tailnet
# addresses and forwards to that loopback port. A secure context is what service
# workers, push and the clipboard need, so the dev UI behaves like production.
# serve runs in the foreground as our child, which makes its config ephemeral:
# tailscaled drops it when the CLI goes away, SIGKILL included, so a dead run
# never leaves a listener behind.
#
# Vite runs as dev-web.yaml's `command:` under a FOREGROUND `isb up`, not as
# an `isb exec`, so the container's life is tied to whoever started it. isb
# stops the container when Vite exits, on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP, and, the
# reason for all this, when any process that started it exits: it polls its
# ancestors every second. An agent that ran `mise run dev` as a background task
# and then went away did not always signal its descendants, which left the
# container and its tailnet port up with nobody attached. Now isb notices, stops
# the container, and this script and the dev task's backend unwind behind it.
# The cost: ending the dev server stops the container under any other task
# running in this worktree at that moment (a `mise run lint`), and the next
# task pays a few seconds of boot.
#
# Both devices are removed on exit; leaving them behind would hold the tailscale
# port. A run that died without its trap (SIGKILL) leaves them on the container
# isb stopped, and whichever task starts it next removes them first: every
# container_ensure reaps them unless this script's dev lock is held (container.sh,
# container_reap_dev_ports). The next `mise run dev` needs no reap: a stale
# `backend` differs and is replaced, and a stale `vite` still inside the search
# range is this worktree's own and is kept.

# `vite` device: a device left behind by a run that died without its trap
# (SIGKILL, a closed terminal) is garbage to reclaim, not a session to make way
