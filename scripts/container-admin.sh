# A container belongs to the worktree recorded in its user.lasso.worktree key
# at creation. Worktrees come and go faster than anyone deletes containers, so
# `prune` removes the ones whose worktree directory no longer exists. It is a
# dry run unless given -y, and it never touches a container whose worktree is
# still on disk, whatever state it is in — another agent may be mid-task in it.
#
# The old shared containers (dev-lasso, dev-lasso-2, ...) carry no such key:
# their mount followed whichever worktree ran last, so it says nothing about
# who is using them. They are listed as `legacy` and never pruned here; delete
# them by hand once nothing runs in them (`isb rm dev-lasso`).
#
# Both halves go through isb, which reads the lasso.worktree label (stored as
# user.lasso.worktree) that scripts/isb/dev.yaml sets.
