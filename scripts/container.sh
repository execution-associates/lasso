# Shared helpers for running lasso's frontend work inside an incus container
# instead of on titan. The container itself is declared in scripts/isb/*.yaml
# and driven by isb (https://github.com/execution-associates/isb), which talks
# to incusd over its unix socket: every step has a deadline, a stalled create
# is cancelled and retried instead of hanging, and the container is created
# with every mount and label in one request, before its first boot. The incus
# CLI is gone from this path on purpose: `incus init`/`launch` read instance
# YAML from stdin whenever stdin is not a terminal, so under an agent or a task
# runner whose stdin is an inherited socket that never closes, it blocked
# forever before ever reaching the server (seen: 11 minutes, no operation).
# This file only computes the per-worktree name and paths and wraps the calls.
#
# Why: `bun install` and the Vite dev server are the only places in this repo
# where code we didn't write executes. On the host that is the SSH key, the
# 1Password session and the tunnel credentials. In an unprivileged container it
# is an unprivileged uid in its own userns with one directory mounted.
#
# Only src/web and brand/icon are mounted, deliberately — NOT the repo root. A
# postinstall script that could reach ../.git could drop a hook, and the global
# post-commit hook auto-pushes main, so a writable .git is a path back out to
# the host.
#
# ONE CONTAINER PER WORKTREE. lasso is developed in many git worktrees at once,
# each with its own agent. There used to be a single shared `dev-lasso` whose
# `web` device was re-pointed at whichever worktree ran a task last, so worktree
# B's `mise run lint` unmounted the tree under worktree A's running Vite
# ("Rolldown panicked ... Failed to get current dir", SIGABRT) — or, worse, let
# A's next build run against B's files. Now the name is derived from the
# checkout (container_name), each container only ever mounts its own worktree,
# and no task can touch another worktree's container. node_modules was never
# the problem: `bun install` writes it into the mounted src/web, i.e. into each
# worktree's own host directory. What IS shared is bun's download cache — see
# container_bun_cache.
#
# The containers are disposable. Delete one and the next task rebuilds it from
# the dev-base image in about a minute. `mise run dev:containers` lists them
# with the worktree each belongs to; `mise run dev:prune` removes the ones whose
# worktree is gone, which titan's weekly lasso-prune timer also does (keyed on
# user.lasso.worktree, so keep that label). The dev-base image itself comes
# from scripts/dev-base.sh (--force rebuilds it from scratch). To refresh the
# toolchain in place: start the stopped dev-base container, update it,
# `incus publish dev-base --alias dev-base --reuse -f`.
#
# Idle containers are left running, not stopped after each task, with one
# exception: `mise run dev` holds a foreground `isb up`, which stops this
# worktree's container when the dev server ends (container-dev-web.sh says
# why), and the next task starts it again. An idle one
# holds ~11 MiB of anonymous memory (measured on titan, 2026-09-27, cgroup
# memory.stat after a build); `incus info` shows over a GiB, but that is page
# cache from reading node_modules, which the kernel reclaims under pressure.
# The 8 CPU / 8 GiB below are caps, not reservations. Stopping when idle would
# need a cross-process refcount so a `mise run lint` exiting never stops the
# container under the same worktree's running `mise run dev`, plus a boot on
# every task after — all to save memory that isn't really spent. Stop one by
# hand (`isb stop <name>`) if you like; the next task starts it again.
