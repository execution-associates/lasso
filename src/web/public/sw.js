// lasso's service worker. It exists for exactly one reason: a Web Push message
// can only be delivered to a service worker, and on iOS that is the only way to
// reach a phone whose screen is off (16.4+, and only for a lasso added to the
// Home Screen).
//
// It deliberately has NO fetch handler and caches nothing. lasso is a live view
// of machines you are driving — proxied terminals, SSE, cross-host pane polls —
// so an offline shell of it would be a lie, and a stale cached bundle in front
// of a self-updating binary is a support burden with no upside. Registered
// lazily by lib/push.ts when notifications are switched on, so a user who never
// opts in never installs one.
//
// Served from web/public, i.e. copied verbatim into the build. It is plain JS on
// purpose: no bundler, no imports, so what lands at /sw.js is what is written
// here.

// Take over immediately rather than waiting for every tab to close. Safe here
// precisely because there is no fetch handler: a new worker cannot serve a
// different asset version to a page than the one it booted with.
