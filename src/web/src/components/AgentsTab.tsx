// The agent list as a SIDEBAR TAB, for the widths with no room to dock one
// beside the chat: below md the footer that carries the sidebar toggle is hidden
// and the chat's own docked column hides itself, so this is how a phone — and a
// tablet too narrow for the footer — picks which conversation it is reading.
//
// It lives in the sidebar rather than inside the chat (where it used to be a
// sheet over the conversation) because the sidebar is a phone's whole chrome:
// the same panel carries Files, Settings and the creator, the tab strip already
// remembers which face you were on, and the list is reachable from the TERMINAL
// this way too, where a sheet inside the chat was not. The tab is md:hidden — at
// md+ the docked column (AgentSidebar) is the same list, and exactly one of the
// two is reachable at any width.
//
// A phone gets a STACK and anything wider gets a grid, which is the whole
// difference screen size makes here: a tile holds a name, a machine, a worktree
// and a status, none of which grow with the viewport, so the second column is
// free real estate where there is room for it and a squeezed name where there is
// not.
