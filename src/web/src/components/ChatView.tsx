// The agent session as a conversation: what the terminal shows, rendered so a
// phone can read it without a 40-column TUI. The shape follows Moshi's chat
// view — a tool result grouped into a card, thinking folded away, a diff
// excerpted rather than dumped — but the palette is lasso's own, so it inherits
// whatever theme (and backdrop) the rest of the app is wearing.
//
// Input stays the real TUI, deliberately: the composer pastes into the herdr
// terminal and presses Enter, and an ask is answered by typing its dialog's own
// keystrokes (AskCard → POST /api/chat/answer). Nothing here answers an agent
// out of band — every write lands in the pane, so a card always says what the
// harness actually received.

// One measure for the conversation AND the composer: a centred column with a
// cap, so a wide window reads like an article instead of a 200-character line
// — and the input sits exactly under the rows it answers, which is the whole
// reason the two share a constant rather than each naming a width.
//
// Applied inside the padding, so it is a no-op on a phone (the screen is
// narrower than the cap) and needs no breakpoint. Every element that carries it
// also carries the SAME horizontal padding, or the two columns would be capped
// against different available widths and drift apart by the difference.

// growing) and rows that are new are APPENDED — the transcript is append-only,
// so anything unseen is newer than everything seen.
//
// Replacing the list instead, which is what a single-page view does, is what
// makes a conversation develop a hole: the live window is the last N kilobytes,
// so once the file grows past it the rows at its start fall out, and they are
// exactly the history someone scrolls up to find.
//
// A page is parsed INDEPENDENTLY of its neighbours, so an older page can hold a
// call whose result landed in a newer one and parse it as still running. Letting
// that version through would flip a finished card back to "running" for good, so
// a state regression is refused and the newer parse stands. That is also what
// makes the result independent of the order the pages arrived in, which is not

            At md+ the input takes the width and the two actions stack against

            One set of buttons serves both layouts, which is what the wrapper is

            column, while below md `contents` dissolves it and lets the two
            buttons be the row's own flex items — `order` (1 and 3) then
            interleaves them around the input (2) that follows them in the DOM.
            The cost of that ordering is a keyboard reaching the pair before the

            so it costs the mouse-and-keyboard flow nothing. */}
