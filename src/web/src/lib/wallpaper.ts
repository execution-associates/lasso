// Theme backgrounds: which image (if any) a theme paints behind the chrome and
// the terminals, plus the two knobs that go with one — the scrim that keeps
// glyphs readable over a photograph, and the palette-derived shading that gives
// a themed canvas some depth with no image at all.
//
// All of it is SERVER-owned. The picks live in lasso's own db as two fields of
// ui_state (theme_atmosphere, custom_backgrounds), reached through the same
// React Query cache, patch-merge and ui_state_rev SSE bump as the sidebar
// layout and the usage footer (lib/ui-state.ts). So a still picked on a phone
// paints on the desktop within a beat and with no reload, and a browser that
// has never been told anything wears what the last human chose. Nothing here
// touches herdr's config.toml — this is lasso's own UI state, not the shared
// theme, so nothing is mirrored to another host or to an agent CLI.
//
// The choice is stored PER THEME name — the one the BROWSER resolved, so a tab
// wearing the palette named for its scheme dresses that palette rather than
// herdr's — which means switching back and forth restores the backdrop each
// theme had rather than dragging one image across all of them. Two browsers
// resolving two different themes (one on the OS's light scheme, one on dark)
// therefore still differ on screen while agreeing on the state.
//
// Only explicit choices are stored: an absent entry is this module's default
// (below), never a value written back. That is what keeps a tab whose fetch is
// still in flight from persisting a default over a choice it hasn't seen yet —
// and why nothing paints until the fetch settles (see atmosphereKnown).
//
// Three sources feed the gallery for a theme:
//   1. what lasso bundles (retro-82's 27 vendored stills, and each brand
//      theme's own site art, served from the embedded build — the sets that
//      never touch the network),
//   2. what the theme itself shipped (an installed Omarchy theme clones its own
//      backgrounds; the server hands back root-relative URLs — see
//      ThemeCatalogEntry.backgrounds),
//   3. what a human handed lasso by hand: a URL, or a file uploaded to the
//      host through /api/paste-file and read back through /api/file. Kept
//      server-side too, so the picture is offerable from every browser.
// They are additive and deduped by URL, since a theme can plausibly be both
// bundled and installed.
