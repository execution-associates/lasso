  // agent's own UI, which is the one thing a dismissal must never do. It is the
  // whole gesture that has to go, not just the pointerdown: a touch is trailed
  // by a synthetic mousedown/mouseup/click, and terminal.ts's long-press
  // right-click and tap-to-reconnect watch touchstart/touchend. Window capture
  // is the only place that reaches all of them — it runs before both of those
  // document-capture listeners and before anything xterm binds to its own
  // elements. The swallow is scoped to the dismissing POINTER (plus the short
  // tail its compatibility events arrive in), not to a fixed slice of time, so
  // the next gesture is the terminal's again and no half-seen touch sequence
