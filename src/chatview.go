// phone can read and answer it without a 40-column terminal.
//
// The transcript is the feed, and herdr is what names it: every pane carries
// pane.agent_session, and for omp that is kind="path" — an absolute .jsonl
// lasso can read locally or over SFTP. So this needs no hook, no daemon and no
// per-harness integration: the file the agent already writes is the whole
// thing, and it works for any host lasso can drive.
//
// Reading never writes, and answering does so only through the pane's own
// dialog. The composer pastes into the same pane (see ChatView.tsx), and an ask
// is answered by typing the keystrokes a human would at the question the agent
// is showing (see serveChatAnswer) — so nothing here can put words in an
// agent's mouth that its own TUI did not accept, and a card still says what the
// pane actually received.
//
// This mirrors the shape Moshi's app renders (see the design notes in
// ChatView.tsx), but the labels are better than Moshi can have: omp stamps a
// written `i` intent on every tool call, so a card reads "Bash · Reading pane
// control help" instead of a truncated command line.

// Bounded by one window, and skipped entirely when the end IS the end of the
