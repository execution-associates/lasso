// Notifications — lasso telling a HUMAN about something that happened while
// they were not looking at it. Distinct from `notice` (main.go), which is a
// toast pushed over SSE to tabs that are already open and watching: by
// construction that reaches nobody when the laptop is shut and the phone is in
// a pocket, which is the only case a notification is for.
//
// The shape is two registries so that the second of either costs nothing:
//
//   - a KIND says what happened (agent blocked, today). Kinds are what a user
//     will eventually want to switch on and off individually, so they are a
//     closed enum rather than free-form strings.
//   - a TRANSPORT says how it reaches the human. Web Push (webpush.go) is the
//     only one today; ntfy, email, or an iMessage bridge would each be another
//     implementation of the same interface and would need no change here.
//
// Everything above the transport is deliberately ignorant of Web Push: a
// notification carries text, a collapse tag, and the host the event happened
// on — not endpoints, VAPID keys, or a URL. Transports own their addressing.
