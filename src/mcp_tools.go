// MCP tool surface. Each tool is a thin wrapper over lasso's existing herdr
// machinery, resolved against an optional `host` (default "local") via
// resolveBackend. Three groups:
//   - discovery:   list_hosts, list_repos, list_branches
//   - spawning:    create_agent (loop it for the bulk "one per repo" case)
//   - orchestration: list_agents, get_agent, close_agent
//   - messaging:   send_agent, read_agent, wait_agent, get_replies,
//                  reply_message (agentmsg.go; replies arrive over tailcat,
//                  replyinbox.go)
//   - introspection: whoami (an agent maps its own $HERDR_PANE_ID back to its
//                  lasso record, typically to then close_agent itself)
//   - notifying:   notify (an agent pushes a notification to its HUMAN — the
//                  deliberate counterpart to the blocked watcher; see notify.go)
//   - showing:     open_file (an agent opens a file in its human's sidebar file
//                  viewer, e.g. a doc it just wrote; see openfile.go)
//   - browsing:    shared_browser (starts the Chromium a human watches in the
//                  Browser tab and says where to connect; see mcp_browser.go)

// registerMCPTools wires every tool onto the server. The In/Out struct types
// drive the JSON Schemas the SDK advertises (field docs come from `jsonschema`
// tags; fields are optional iff their json tag carries `omitempty`).

Use the returned alias as the `host` argument of the other tools; omit `host` to target the local box. Answers immediately from lasso's background host probe, so it may be a PARTIAL picture: an entry with state \"probing\" has not finished being probed and one with state \"timeout\" did not answer in time — neither means the host is down, so call again in a second or two (or with refresh:true) instead of reporting those hosts as unavailable. Top-level `probing:true` says at least one entry is still filling in.",

The optional prompt becomes the agent's initial task; `model` picks the CLI's model and `effort` its thinking/reasoning level (omit either for the CLI's default), and `extra_args` appends verbatim CLI flags; `advisor` turns on omp's per-turn advisor runtime. Set plan_mode to have it plan before acting — it then blocks for approval when it is ready to execute (see the field description). Returns immediately with the agent's id, workspace, and root pane; the agent boots asynchronously.

Covers BOTH the agents lasso created (lasso_created:true, addressable by id) AND foreign herdr sessions lasso did not create — long-lived bots like \"Clem (OCAI)\" running in their own panes (lasso_created:false, no lasso id; address them by sidebar_name or root_pane). Pass a sidebar_name or root_pane to get_agent to inspect either kind. `host` must be one list_hosts shows you: the local box or an ssh-config alias, and within your credential's scope. Any other host is refused, so agents on machines this lasso cannot connect to — or in another trust zone — are not listable. Omitting `host` lists YOUR OWN host, not lasso's. Only agents herdr still has a pane for are listed: a lasso agent whose pane or workspace was closed is reconciled away on this call, so every id you get back is one you can actually inspect and close. `agents` is an empty array when the host genuinely has none; a `herdr_error` alongside it means the listing is PARTIAL — herdr could not be enumerated, so live statuses, sidebar names, and every foreign session are missing, nothing was reconciled (an unreachable herdr is not evidence that an agent died, so records are kept), and the host may well have agents this call cannot see.",

The lasso MCP server runs in lasso's own process, NOT your shell, so it cannot read your environment — you MUST supply $HERDR_PANE_ID yourself. With no `host`: if your credential names the host you run on, that host alone is searched (so a pane id that exists on several hosts still resolves); otherwise every host lasso can address is searched — the local box plus hosts with an alias in its ssh config (pane ids are only unique per host, and your pane is not necessarily on the box the MCP server runs on): a unique match resolves; a cross-host collision returns found:false naming the candidate hosts, so call again with the host you run on. On success returns found:true and the same fields as a list_agents entry (id, type, title, repo, branch, work_dir, root_pane, workspace_id, status, host, ...) under `agent` — pass BOTH the returned id and host to close_agent. If it can't resolve (no pane_id given, or the pane isn't one lasso manages) it returns found:false with a human-readable `detail` instead of erroring.",

Target it by `agent_id`, or by `pane_id` — pass your own $HERDR_PANE_ID to close YOURSELF without resolving your id via whoami first. Pass the `host` whoami/list_agents returned alongside the id; with no host every host you may address is searched (the local box and hosts with an alias in lasso's ssh config, narrowed to your credential's scope — anywhere else is out of reach), and an id that exists on several hosts is refused rather than guessed, so the wrong host's agent is never killed.",

It reaches a locked device, so it is not free: an agent that pings on every step trains them to ignore it. Pass your own $HERDR_PANE_ID as pane_id and the notification is titled with your agent's name and opens on your host, so they know who is asking without reading the body; the server cannot read your environment, so you must supply it. Nothing is collapsed or rate-limited — you asked once and it is delivered once.
