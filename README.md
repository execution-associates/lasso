An agent that has been waiting forty minutes on a `y/n` you never saw is an
agent doing nothing. lasso is a single Go binary that puts your whole fleet of
coding agents — every SSH-reachable machine, its [herdr](https://herdr.dev)
session, every pane — in a browser tab, and in a phone app that **buzzes when
one of them needs you**. Approve the tool call from the couch. Read the diff
on the train. Hand the agent a photo of the whiteboard from your camera roll.

- **Your real terminal, anywhere.** The middle column is your actual herdr
  session over `ttyd` — same keys, same theme, same panes. lasso adds around it,
  never in front of it.
- **The phone is a first-class client.** Home-screen app, a radial dial for the
  keys a touch keyboard doesn't have (Esc, Ctrl, Tab, arrows), a text field so
  dictation and autocorrect work, and file/photo upload straight into the
  agent's host.
- **It tells you when an agent is stuck.** Web Push to a locked phone when an
  agent blocks on a tool approval, a plan gate or a question — on any host —
  and when an agent pings you on purpose with `lasso notify "safe on prod?"`.
- **The sidebar follows the focused pane.** A live git diff and a file browser
  and editor, rooted on the machine that pane is actually working on — even
  when the pane is an SSH window onto another box.
- **A browser you and your agents share.** A real Chromium streamed into the
  sidebar: you watch — and click in — the same pages an agent is driving over
  the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
- **Agents orchestrating agents.** An MCP server lets one agent spawn, list,
  inspect and close the others, across the fleet.
- **Nothing to deploy.** One binary, no database, no container, no sidecar. It
  spawns its own terminals and embeds its own frontend.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://executionassociates.com/install-lasso | sh
```

Then:

```bash
lasso start          # run it in the background
open http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

Run `lasso doctor` if anything looks off. To reach it from a phone you want an
HTTPS origin — see [Exposing it](#exposing-it) and [On a phone](#on-a-phone).

Lasso 2.13 targets **Herdr v0.9.0 (protocol 22)**. Upgrade Herdr on the host
and its remote machines together; Settings reports incompatible versions.
Herdr's native SSH machine list is separate from Lasso's host selector:
`herdr machine add <ssh-alias> --label <name>` prepares and saves a machine.
Upgrading an older Herdr server can end its running pane processes; checkpoint
active work before approving a restart.

### Connect your agents

```bash
lasso connect        # register lasso's MCP servers with every agent CLI here
```

It finds Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and omp on the machine and adds two
servers to each: **`lasso`** (`/mcp` — spawn, list and close agents, `notify`)
and **`lasso-browser`** (`/browser-mcp` — the [shared browser](#shared-browser)).
It checks lasso answers first, and re-running it is safe. On another machine,
point it at the URL *that* machine reaches lasso on: `lasso connect -url
https://lasso.example.com` (add `-header` for a Cloudflare Access service
token; `lasso connect -h` has the rest). By hand it is:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http lasso         http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp
claude mcp add --transport http lasso-browser http://127.0.0.1:8090/browser-mcp
```

Other CLIs add the same two URLs as streamable-HTTP MCP servers.
`lasso-browser` needs Chrome or Chromium and `chrome-devtools-mcp` installed
on **lasso's** machine ([Setup](#setup), [Connecting an
agent](#connecting-an-agent)); without them `lasso connect` registers `lasso`
alone and says what's missing.

## The tour

Everything here follows herdr's focused pane, so switching agent switches all
of it at once.

### Your thumbs, on a real terminal

A touch screen has no Esc, no Ctrl, no arrows and no right-click. They live in
a **radial dial** (the phone up top) — hold the ⌘ button and slide, or tap to
open the ring: common keys, a plain text field so autocorrect and dictation
work, file/photo upload straight into the agent's host, the New Agent dialog,
and lasso's own panels. Drag to scroll, long-press for right-click.

### It tells you when an agent is stuck

An agent that blocks on a tool approval or a plan gate stops until a human
answers, and nothing else will tell you. lasso watches every reachable host in
the background and pushes to your phone — and an agent can also ping you
deliberately with `lasso notify "the migration drops 2 columns — safe to run on
prod?"`. Nothing is polled at all while no device is registered. Setup is in
[Notifications](#notifications-ios-home-screen).

### Every machine you can SSH to

The host chip in the corner lists the fleet: every alias in your ssh config
that answers, with the herdr version it's running, collapsed into groups where
you have several. Picking one moves **this browser tab** to that machine —
its terminal, its panes, its files. Another tab stays where it was, so two
tabs sit on two machines at once.

A host that isn't answering says so rather than hanging the list:

<img src="docs/screenshots/hosts.png" alt="the host switcher listing the fleet, one host marked timed out" width="300">

### Diff — what the agent in the focused pane has actually changed

Working tree while it's dirty, branch-vs-base once it's clean. It re-roots
itself as focus moves between panes and machines, so the diff is always the one
you're looking at. Here it is on lasso's own repo, mid-redesign of the footer
navigation, with one file's hunks expanded:

<img src="docs/screenshots/diff.png" alt="the Diff pane showing lasso's own working tree: seven dirty files, one expanded to its hunks" width="620">

### Files — browse and edit the box the pane is working on

A real tree with a markdown/code/image viewer and an editor that saves back.
It follows the focused pane's directory until you type a path, then it stays
put. Reads and writes go to **that pane's host**, so editing a remote agent's
file doesn't silently save to the wrong machine. Ask an agent to "open it for
me" and it can put the doc it just wrote right here (`lasso open <path>` / the
`open_file` MCP tool).

<img src="docs/screenshots/files.png" alt="the Files pane browsing a repository" width="620">

### Browser — the page the agent is working on, next to the agent

Type a bare port (`5173`) or any URL and the page sits beside the terminal, so
you watch it reload as the agent works. The tab has two modes, switched from
its toolbar (and remembered on the server, so every device opens the same one):

- **Agent** (the default whenever lasso can find a Chromium) is the
  [shared browser](#shared-browser): a real headless Chromium running on
  lasso's machine, streamed into the tab and driven by your mouse, keyboard and
  touch. It shows one page at a time, **following whichever page was opened
  last**, so when an agent opens one you're watching it click through the app
  it just built, and it sees the page you just opened. Because it's a real browser rather than a frame, no
  site refuses to load and no mixed-content rule applies. A bare port means
  `localhost` **on lasso's machine**.
- **Iframe** is a plain iframe in your own browser, with nothing in between —
  which also means your browser's rules apply (an HTTPS page can't frame an
  HTTP dev server, a public origin can't frame a private one, and many sites
  forbid being framed at all). lasso detects all three and offers to open the
  page in a new tab. A bare port means that port on the hostname you reached
  lasso by. With no Chromium installed, the tab uses Embed and says why.

Links you click in a terminal open here too (Settings → General → Terminal &
browser turns that off; Cmd/Ctrl-click always opens a new browser tab). In Agent mode each link
opens as a **new page**, so it never navigates away from a page an agent is
using.

<img src="docs/screenshots/browser.png" alt="the Browser pane framing a running Vite dev server" width="440">

### What your agents are burning

The footer tracks each provider's rate-limit window — 5-hour and weekly — so
you can see a budget running out before an agent stops mid-task. Providers you
have no credentials for stay hidden automatically; the rest you order and
switch on/off under **Settings → General → Sidebar & usage**. Switching one off stops the
polling too, so a provider you don't use costs no requests.

The desktop footer also holds **New**, **Sidebar**, **Host**, and **Keybindings**.
Those controls remain available even with no tracked providers or unavailable
usage data; there is no footer-visibility toggle. Usage metrics scroll within
their own track rather than pushing navigation offscreen.

<img src="docs/screenshots/usage-footer.png" alt="the desktop footer: host and keyboard-shortcut buttons on the left, each provider's 5-hour and weekly budgets in the middle, New and Sidebar on the right" width="700">

The **Usage** tab in the sidebar is the same numbers in full: every window per
provider with its own bar, a notch at the share of the window that has already
elapsed, and — when usage is running ahead of that clock — where it lands at
reset. So "28%, ahead of pace, ~165% at reset" tells you a weekly budget is
going to run out before the window ever resets, while the footer still reads a
comfortable 28%.

<img src="docs/screenshots/usage-tab.png" alt="the Usage sidebar tab: per-provider quota windows with pace notches, projected landings, and reset countdowns" width="460">

## Using the CLI

The binary is both the server and its own control surface:

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `lasso start` (alias `up`) | start the server in the background (PID + log under `~/.lasso/`) |
| `lasso stop` (alias `down`) | stop the background server |
| `lasso restart` | stop (if running) then start |
| `lasso status` | report whether it's running, and its URL |
| `lasso update` | update to the latest release (see [Updating](#updating)) |
| `lasso doctor` | check herdr, the socket, the port, and the version |
| `lasso version` | print the version |
| `lasso notify "<msg>"` | push a notification to the human running lasso (the `notify` MCP tool) — for agents |
| `lasso open <path> [-line n] [-host h]` | open a file in the human's sidebar file viewer, in every visible lasso tab (the `open_file` MCP tool) — for agents; exits non-zero when no tab is open |
| `lasso mcp [tool] [flags]` | call lasso's MCP tools from a shell; no tool lists them, `<tool> -h` shows its flags |
| `lasso plugin list\|enable\|disable\|trust\|untrust\|restart\|reload [name]` | manage [plugins](#plugins); `enable` prints the permissions it approves |
| `lasso connect` | register lasso's two MCP servers (`lasso`, `lasso-browser`) with the agent CLIs on this machine; `-url` for another machine, `-remove` to undo, `-dry-run` to preview |
| `lasso serve` | run in the **foreground** (what a bare `lasso` does) |

`start`/`restart`/`serve` accept the server flags (`-listen`, `-theme`,
`-insecure-no-auth`, …); `lasso serve -h` lists them.

## What's in it

Two resizable, collapsible columns:

- **Left** — the **herdr** terminal (a `ttyd` session in an iframe), with no
  header row covering the workspace. ⌘K still opens herdr's own pane search.
- **Right** — the git **Diff** of the focused pane's repo, a **Files** browser
  that follows the active pane's directory and opens files in a
  markdown/code/image viewer, a **Browser** that shows a local dev-server port
  (`5173`) or any URL you type — live from the [shared
  browser](#shared-browser), or as an iframe — a plain **Terminal** shell
  outside herdr, a **Usage** tab with every provider quota window in full
  (bars, pace, reset countdowns — the footer's detail view), and **Settings**
  (the lasso version and whether an update is available, the herdr
  protocol/version with a one-click `herdr update`, notifications for blocked
  agents, and the New-Agent defaults). Settings folds into collapsible groups,
  all closed by default; a closed group's header still summarizes its state
  (a plugin waiting for approval shows there in warning colour), and which
  groups you keep open is remembered per browser.

Which of those tabs show, and in what order, is yours: Settings → General →
Sidebar & usage. [Plugins](#plugins) add tabs of their own to the same strip.

Desktop navigation lives in the footer, not a floating overlay. On phones the
footer stays out of the terminal viewport and the existing ⌘ input dial supplies
New, host switching, sidebar access, and the keys a touch keyboard lacks.

The UI follows herdr's active pane live. The **terminal** adopts herdr's theme
(its xterm palette tracks `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`); the surrounding
**chrome** wears whatever Settings → Themes → Appearance says — herdr's own colors, each
device's system light/dark preference, or a pinned scheme — and that choice is
stored on the server, so every browser on the same lasso agrees.

## MCP: agents orchestrating agents

lasso exposes an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at `/mcp`, so an
agent can spawn, list, inspect and close **other** agents — across every host
lasso can reach. `create_agent`, `list_agents`, `get_agent`, `close_agent`,
`list_hosts`, `whoami`, `notify`, `open_file` (show the human a file in the
sidebar viewer), and `shared_browser` (see
[Shared browser](#shared-browser)). Enabled [plugins](#plugins) add their own
tools beside them, as `<plugin>__<tool>`.

```bash
lasso connect      # or: claude mcp add --transport http lasso http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp
```

That registers it — and the browser server beside it — with every agent CLI on
the machine ([Connect your agents](#connect-your-agents)). They are **two
servers**, `lasso` at `/mcp` and `lasso-browser` at `/browser-mcp`, because
they are two jobs: orchestrating agents, and driving the [shared
browser](#shared-browser) with chrome-devtools-mcp's whole toolset. An agent
that only needs one is not handed the other's tools, and each can be added,
gated or dropped on its own.

Talking to an agent is not lasso's job: prompt it, read its screen and wait on
it with herdr (`herdr agent prompt` / `read` / `wait`), or, from Claude Code,
its native agent messaging.

It is **unauthenticated by default** (same trust model as the file endpoints —
fine on loopback or a private tailnet, behind Cloudflare Access, or gated by
setting `MCP_OAUTH`). Which agents a caller may see and address is bounded by
per-host OAuth credentials and groups; see [`docs/mcp-agent-scope.md`](docs/mcp-agent-scope.md).

## Shared browser

The Browser tab's **Agent** mode and your agents use one Chromium: lasso
launches it headless on **its own machine**, streams it into the tab, and
exposes it to agents over the [Chrome DevTools
Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) at `/cdp` — and
as an MCP server at `/browser-mcp`, so an agent just adds one URL. An
agent testing a login flow opens its page in the shared browser and you watch
it happen — and can take the mouse — from your phone.

It costs nothing until it's used. The first `/cdp` connection, the Browser tab
or **Settings → General → Terminal & browser** starts it; it stops again after 15
minutes with nothing connected. It is the same browser whatever host a tab is
on, so `localhost` inside it always means **lasso's machine**.

### Setup

Install Chromium or Google Chrome on the machine lasso runs on. lasso looks,
first hit wins, for:

1. `-browser` / `LASSO_BROWSER` — a path or a PATH name (`off` disables the
   feature),
2. `chromium`, `chromium-browser`, `google-chrome-stable`, `google-chrome`,
   `chrome` on `PATH`,
3. the newest Playwright build in `~/.cache/ms-playwright`,
4. on macOS, `Google Chrome.app` and `Chromium.app` in `/Applications`.

With none found, the Browser tab falls back to Embed and Settings says what's
missing.

| flag | env | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-browser` | `LASSO_BROWSER` | search (above) | Chromium to launch: a path, a PATH name, or `off` to disable the shared browser. |
| — | `LASSO_BROWSER_ARGS` | — | Extra Chromium flags, split on whitespace. |
| `-browser-idle` | `LASSO_BROWSER_IDLE` | `15m` | Stop Chromium after this long with no `/cdp` client connected. `0` never stops it. |
| `-browser-cpu` | `LASSO_BROWSER_CPU` | `200%` | `CPUQuota` of the systemd user scope it runs in. `off` (or empty) lifts it. |
| `-browser-mem` | `LASSO_BROWSER_MEM` | `2G` | `MemoryHigh` of that scope. `off` (or empty) lifts it. |
| `-browser-scale` | `LASSO_BROWSER_SCALE` | `2` | Device scale factor Chromium renders at, so the Agent view is sharp on a HiDPI screen. `1` for Chromium's default; each step costs raster CPU and makes agents' screenshots larger. |

**The resource cap matters.** Headless Chromium on a machine with no GPU
renders in software and will happily take several cores. On Linux, when
`systemd-run` and a user systemd manager (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`) are available,
lasso runs Chromium in a transient `systemd-run --user --scope` with those
limits; with both limits `off`, or on macOS, it runs uncapped. Settings shows
which.

The browser's profile lives in `~/.lasso/browser-profile` (under `LASSO_DIR`
if set): cookies and logins persist across restarts, open tabs don't — an idle
stop closes them. Two lasso instances can't share one profile; give a second
one its own `LASSO_DIR`.

> **Ubuntu 23.10 and later:** Chromium's sandbox needs unprivileged user
> namespaces, which Ubuntu now grants only to binaries with an AppArmor
> profile. Playwright's download, or any Chromium you unpacked yourself, has
> none and fails with *"No usable sandbox!"* — Settings shows that message.
> lasso deliberately does **not** fall back to `--no-sandbox` on its own. Fix
> it by installing a packaged Google Chrome (or your distro's Chromium), which
> Ubuntu ships a profile for; or add an AppArmor profile granting `userns` to
> the binary you want; or, knowingly, run it unsandboxed with
> `LASSO_BROWSER_ARGS=--no-sandbox`. (Running lasso as root adds
> `--no-sandbox` automatically, because Chromium refuses to start without it.)

### Connecting an agent

lasso serves Google's
[chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)
at **one MCP URL, `/browser-mcp`**, already pointed at the shared browser. An
agent adds that URL and gets chrome-devtools-mcp's tools (navigate, click,
fill, screenshot, console, network, performance traces, …) against the same
Chromium you're watching, with nothing installed on the agent's machine:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http lasso-browser http://127.0.0.1:8090/browser-mcp
```

Other agents (Codex, OpenCode, …) add the same URL as a streamable-HTTP MCP
server. Settings shows the exact URL, a copyable command, and how many agents
are using it.

**That one URL drives every browser profile.** A profile is a separate
Chromium with its own cookies, logins and proxy (the picker at the bottom of
the Browser tab; `list_browser_profiles` and friends on `/mcp`). Every
`/browser-mcp` tool takes an optional `profile` — an id like `work` or a
display name — and runs in that profile's browser; leave it out for the
default. Profiles are looked up when the call runs, so one created, renamed or
deleted later needs no new MCP server and no reconnect: add `lasso-browser`
once, at user scope, and forget about it. Page ids belong to one profile, so
keep passing the same `profile` for a page you opened there. (The older
per-profile URLs, `/browser-mcp/<id>`, still work, pinned to that profile.)

chrome-devtools-mcp only speaks stdio, so lasso bridges it: **each MCP session
gets its own `chrome-devtools-mcp` process per profile it actually uses**,
started on the first tool call for that profile. Each agent gets its own
selected page, console and network buffers, and nobody steers anyone else's
page. Connecting costs nothing: a session that never calls a browser tool
starts no process (lasso answers the tool list from a copy it learned once),
so a user-scope entry loaded by every agent session on the box is free until
one of them actually browses. When a profile's browser stops or restarts,
only that profile's process in each session is closed, and the next call
starts a fresh one; the session's process for other profiles carries on. A
session ends — and all its processes with it — when the agent closes it, after
30 minutes with no requests, or when lasso stops.

**Install chrome-devtools-mcp on lasso's machine** (not the agent's):

```bash
npm i -g chrome-devtools-mcp        # or: mise use -g npm:chrome-devtools-mcp
```

lasso deliberately does **not** fall back to `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest`:
fetching an unpinned package at runtime, on the machine holding the browser's
logged-in profile, is a supply-chain risk. Without it `/browser-mcp` answers
503 and Settings says what's missing.

| flag | env | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-browser-mcp` | `LASSO_BROWSER_MCP` | `chrome-devtools-mcp` on `PATH` | The chrome-devtools-mcp to run: a path, a PATH name, or `off` to disable `/browser-mcp`. |
| — | `LASSO_BROWSER_MCP_ARGS` | — | Extra chrome-devtools-mcp flags, split on whitespace (e.g. `--slim`, `--no-category-performance`). |
| `-browser-mcp-max` | `LASSO_BROWSER_MCP_MAX` | `0` (no limit) | Opt-in cap on live chrome-devtools-mcp processes (~175 MB each), counted across every session and profile. Past it, a tool call that would start another fails with an error naming this knob; connecting never does. |

Screenshots come back as JPEG, at most 1280 px on a side: the browser renders
at `-browser-scale` 2, and an unbounded PNG would cost an agent about four
times the image tokens for nothing.

**Raw CDP** is still there for Playwright or any other CDP client:
`ws://<lasso>/cdp` (`wss://` when lasso is on HTTPS), e.g.
`chromium.connectOverCDP("ws://127.0.0.1:8090/cdp")`. The endpoint is stable:
it survives Chromium being stopped, relaunched or restarted with a new proxy,
so it's safe to put in an agent's config. **`GET <lasso>/cdp/profiles`** lists
every browser profile and the CDP address to connect to each one
(`/cdp` for the default, `/cdp/p/<id>` for the others) — discovery for a CDP
client that adds no MCP server, behind `/cdp`'s own auth and Origin guard.

An agent already talking to lasso's MCP server can call **`shared_browser`**
(`lasso mcp shared-browser` from a shell): it starts the browser, answers with
the `/browser-mcp` URL (and the profile's CDP endpoint) and the pages currently open, and
tells the agent the ground rules — open your own tab, leave the others alone,
close yours when you're done.

### Proxy

**Settings → General → Terminal & browser → Proxy** sends all of the shared
browser's traffic through `socks5://`, `socks4://`, `http://` or `https://`
`host:port`. With `socks5://`, DNS is resolved through the proxy too. Proxies
that need a username and password are not supported — Chromium can't
authenticate to a SOCKS proxy, and ignores credentials in its proxy flag.
Changing the proxy restarts Chromium and reopens the pages it had.

### Security

`/cdp` — and `/browser-mcp`, which drives it — is full control of a browser:
whoever can reach it can read every page, type into it and navigate it —
**including every site that browser profile is logged into**. Log the shared
browser into an account only if you're happy for every agent that can reach
either to act as you there.

`/cdp` and `/browser-mcp` are gated alike: open by default (fine on loopback,
a private tailnet, or behind Cloudflare Access), basic auth when `UI_AUTH` is
set, and a lasso bearer token (or the `UI_AUTH` credentials) when `MCP_OAUTH`
is set — a per-host credential must include lasso's own machine in its scope.
A gated agent sends its credential as a header:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  lasso-browser https://lasso.example.com/browser-mcp
```

(A token comes from `lasso mcp-client token`; see
[`docs/mcp-agent-scope.md`](docs/mcp-agent-scope.md).) Whatever the auth
setting, lasso refuses any `/cdp` or `/browser-mcp` request a *different
website* sends from your browser, so a page you visit can't reach a lasso on
your own machine and drive the shared browser. lasso's own chrome-devtools-mcp
processes reach `/cdp` with a random per-process token instead of your
credential, and get a minimal environment without lasso's secrets.

## Plugins

A plugin is a directory in `~/.lasso/plugins/<name>/` with a `plugin.json`, and
it can add **sidebar tabs** (its own web page, next to Files and Browser),
**MCP tools** (on lasso's `/mcp`, as `<plugin>__<tool>`, so every connected
agent — and `lasso mcp` — gets them), **themes** and **fonts**.

<img src="docs/screenshots/plugin-tab.png" alt="the example hello plugin's sidebar tab: the focused pane's context, a Greet button that called the plugin's MCP tool and got a greeting back from its sandbox, and file-open and toast buttons" width="460">

```bash
cp -r examples/plugins/hello ~/.lasso/plugins/
lasso plugin enable hello        # prints exactly what you are approving
lasso mcp hello__greet --name you
```

The design is the trust model:

- **Nothing runs until you enable it**, and enabling approves exactly the
  permissions shown — tabs, image, command, network hosts, env names, and which
  secret may go to which host. If the manifest later asks for more, the plugin
  stops loading until you approve again.
- **Its MCP server runs in an [isb](https://github.com/execution-associates/isb)
  sandbox**: an unprivileged container by default, or a VM with its own kernel
  if you flip it (`lasso plugin vm <name> on`). The plugin directory is mounted
  read-only, nothing else from your machine is, and isb's egress proxy lets it
  reach only the host names it listed. Secrets never enter the guest: isb puts
  the real value on the wire only toward their approved hosts. **Trusted** (run
  it on the host instead) is a flag only you can set. Needs isb 1.0+ with
  `isb serve` running.
- **Its tabs can't call lasso.** They are served as an opaque, sandboxed origin,
  so a plugin page cannot use your session to reach the file endpoints. What it
  can do goes through a small `postMessage` bridge: read the focused pane and
  the theme, open a file in the viewer, call its own tools, and show a toast.

Themes and fonts are data, never CSS. A plugin theme is an Omarchy-format
palette that joins the theme picker, the appearance palettes and the fleet sync
like any installed theme (it never replaces an existing one), and a plugin font
becomes a choice in Settings' **Typography** section for the interface,
display, label, code and terminal text. [`examples/plugins/harbor`](examples/plugins/harbor)
ships one of each:

```bash
cp -r examples/plugins/harbor ~/.lasso/plugins/ && lasso plugin enable harbor
```

Install one from GitHub, or use a local checkout while you write one:

```bash
lasso plugin install owner/repo[/subdir] [--ref v1.2]   # shows the permissions, then asks
lasso plugin update <name>          # re-fetch; says whether the permissions change
lasso plugin uninstall <name>       # GitHub installs only; --purge-data drops its data dir

An install is shallow-cloned into a staging directory and validated before
anything lands in `plugins/`, and it records the exact commit. "Install and
enable" approves exactly the permissions the preview showed. Public plugins
carry the GitHub topic `lasso-plugin`, which anyone can apply: it is not a
reviewed catalog, and the approval and the sandbox are the safety, not the
listing.

Settings → General has a **Plugins** group (install, update, uninstall,
logs, enable, disable, container or VM, trust, restart, MCP status) and a **Sidebar** section for arranging every tab:

<img src="docs/screenshots/sidebar-tabs.png" alt="Settings' Sidebar section: every tab with a visibility toggle and up/down arrows, the hello plugin's tab among them; Settings has no toggle" width="460">

Writing one: [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md) — the manifest, the bridge
protocol, the sandbox, and the HTTP API.

## Run from source

```bash
mise run build      # build the frontend (src/web/dist) then the binary
./lasso             # serves on 127.0.0.1:8090, spawns ttyd running herdr
mise run dev        # Vite dev server (frontend HMR) + Go backend, on your tailnet
mise run test       # Go tests
mise run diagram    # re-render docs/architecture/*.reladraw to SVG
```

The Go backend lives under `src/` (module root, with `go.mod`). The frontend is a
React + Vite + Tailwind (shadcn/ui) app under `src/web/`, built to `src/web/dist`
and embedded into the binary via `go:embed` — so the shipped binary is
self-contained. `go build` therefore needs `src/web/dist` to exist; `mise run build`
produces it. `src/web/dist` is **gitignored** (not committed) — run `mise run build`
locally, and CI builds it for releases.

`mise run dev` serves the UI through Vite with hot reload and proxies the API and
terminal routes to the Go backend: frontend edits reload instantly, Go changes
need a task restart. It binds your tailscale interface and uses a dedicated dev
port that bumps if busy, so it never clashes with a production instance.

The frontend half of all of this — `bun install`, Vite, tsc, biome — runs inside
an unprivileged [incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) container rather than
on your machine, so a compromised npm dependency executes as a throwaway uid with
nothing but `src/web` mounted. The Go backend still runs on the host, and two
incus proxy devices carry the one port each direction needs. The container is
declared in `scripts/isb/*.yaml` and driven by
[isb](https://github.com/execution-associates/isb), pinned in `mise.toml` as a
prebuilt release binary (`mise install` fetches it). `mise run dev` holds a
foreground `isb up`, so its container stops when the dev server ends or when
whatever launched it goes away. `scripts/container.sh` documents the arrangement; the container rebuilds itself
from a base image if you delete it.

## Architecture

<img src="docs/architecture/lasso.svg" alt="lasso architecture: the browser and MCP clients reach the lasso binary through Cloudflare Access; lasso drives the local herdr over its socket and remote herdrs through an SSH pool, keeps state in lasso.db, and sends Web Push to the phone">

One Go binary that serves the embedded SPA, reverse-proxies the `ttyd` terminals
(WebSocket), talks to the herdr server over its unix socket to track the focused
pane and workspace layout, and pushes live state to the browser over SSE. It can
drive herdr on the local box or on SSH-reachable hosts through the footer's host
switcher, so one lasso fronts a whole fleet. Each instance spawns its own ttyds on
unix sockets keyed by PID **and host**, so several instances can run at once
without colliding and so a host keeps its terminal warm: switching back to a host
you were on re-points the proxy at a ttyd that is already bound instead of
respawning one, and one SSH connection per host serves both the terminal and
host-addressed work.
The data and terminal routes live under `/api/*`, `/terminal/`, and `/shell/`,
plus an unauthenticated MCP server at `/mcp`; see the route table in `src/main.go`.

The diagram is [reladraw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reladraw) source in
`docs/architecture/lasso.reladraw`; edit it and run `mise run diagram`, which
renders it inside a throwaway Debian incus container (`scripts/sandbox.sh`).

## Theming

The **terminal** adopts the theme from `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`
(`[theme].name`) and repaints live when you change it — no restart. Leave
`-theme auto` to follow herdr, or force one with `-theme <name>` (`lasso serve -h`
lists the names). **Execution Associates** (`execution-associates`: dark dusk
violet with a peach accent, drawn from executionassociates.com) is the default
when no theme is configured (and the fallback for unknown names); an existing
configured theme still wins. It sits under **Brand** in the picker beside
**Orange County AI** (`ocai`, light: navy ink and a sun-orange accent on cream,
from orangecountyai.com). **Retro 82** (`retro-82`) is still bundled; its navy,
amber, and teal palette comes from
[OldJobobo's Omarchy Retro 82](https://github.com/OldJobobo/omarchy-retro-82-theme).

Every theme can carry a **background image**. Retro 82 defaults to one of 27
stills bundled from upstream's set — no external image requests at runtime.
Settings → **Themes → Background** offers bundled images, installed themes'
images, and custom URLs or uploads. Background selection, **palette shading**,
and **image dimming** are saved **per theme on the server** (lasso's own
`ui_state`, not `config.toml`): every browser reaching the same lasso wears the
same backdrop, and a pick in one repaints the others within a beat, with no
reload. Switching palette restores each theme's own choices. A theme nobody has
dressed yet defaults to shading on and 70% dimming — Retro 82 additionally to
its Dusk Guardian still, the brand themes to their own site art (Execution
Associates' golden-hour coast, Orange County AI's pier), every other theme to no
image. Resetting dimming
affects only the displayed theme. Choices made before this moved server-side
stayed in the browser that made them and are not imported: pick the backdrop
once more and every device follows.
Credits are in `src/web/public/wallpapers/retro-82/NOTICE.txt`.

The terminal uses ttyd's bundled **Canvas renderer**: its WebGL renderer paints
opaque default-background rectangles behind dim text, which breaks transparency.
Retro 82's sidebar selection backgrounds are transparent too; the active row
keeps its accent and bold label instead of a solid strip across the wallpaper.
Sidebar labels use a brighter cream text tier so herdr's additional dimming
does not compound the palette's previously subdued teal.

Retro 82 is lasso's own, not one of herdr's eighteen built-in names — and herdr
rejects a name it doesn't know outright (`herdr config check` errors and the TUI
falls back to catppuccin). So lasso writes it the way herdr supports: `[theme]
name = "vesper"` plus a `[theme.custom]` block that reproduces the palette, each
generated line tagged with a `# lasso-theme` comment. The tag is what makes it
reversible — switching to another theme deletes exactly those lines and leaves
every override you typed, and a token you set yourself is never overwritten.
A config still naming `retro-82` from an older lasso is rewritten into that form
at startup, so no machine is stuck on a rejected name — and if you re-theme in
herdr itself (which writes `[theme].name` and knows nothing about the block),
the stranded lines are cleared the moment lasso notices, since herdr would
otherwise keep painting your new theme in the old one's colors. Your own
`[theme].name` is left exactly as you wrote it, even a name lasso doesn't know.

The **chrome** around the terminal (sidebar, diff, files, settings) is lasso's
own monochrome design system by default, not herdr's palette. Settings →
**Appearance** picks what it follows: Herdr (herdr's own colors, the default),
System (`prefers-color-scheme`), or a pinned Light/Dark. Below it, **Palette**
can name a theme per light/dark scheme — lasso then wears that theme's colors
in the chrome *and* the terminals, resolved by a read, so herdr's config.toml,
the other hosts and the agent CLIs keep the shared theme (which is what makes
System usable with real palettes: an OS flipping at dusk re-themes your
browsers instead of the whole fleet, twice a day).

Both live in lasso's own `ui_state` on the server, not in a browser: pick Dark
on your phone and the desktop follows within a beat, with no reload, and a
fresh browser opens on what you last chose rather than on the defaults. Only
System's *answer* is per device — the OS scheme is an observation about the
screen in front of you, not a preference to share. Appearance choices made in
a browser before this moved server-side are not imported; set them once.

A theme change is pushed to **every reachable host**, in parallel — not just the
one lasso is currently driving, since an agent on any of them can be on screen
at any moment and a half-synced fleet shows two palettes. Each host gets the
same `[theme]` section in the config.toml its own herdr reads (resolved from
that host's environment, not guessed from the socket's directory) — including
the generated block for a lasso-only theme, so no remote `herdr config check`
sees a name it rejects — and the agent CLIs' own theme files (Claude Code,
OpenCode, Oh My Pi, ghostty), so agents render in step with herdr.

**Reachable over ssh is the only requirement.** A theme write is file I/O, so a
host running a herdr this lasso can't drive — one a release behind, or stopped —
is written over a files-only ssh connection instead of being skipped, and only
the "reload your config" nudge to its herdr is lost (that host repaints when its
herdr restarts). A host that was **asleep or unreachable** when the theme changed
catches up on its own: every completed host probe compares the theme lasso last
wrote there against the live one and pushes if they differ, so a laptop converges
within a refresh cycle of coming back rather than staying behind until the next
theme change.

Settings → Themes → Fleet sync switches that off: "Sync agent themes" for the agent CLIs
everywhere, or "Sync theme to hosts" per host, which leaves an unchecked
machine's herdr config and agent themes entirely alone (re-checking it pushes the
current theme straight back).

## Updating

`lasso update` brings the binary up to date. It auto-detects the install:

- A **release binary** (the curl install, or a mise `ubi:` install) downloads the
  latest GitHub release for your platform, verifies its checksum, atomically
  replaces itself, then restarts whatever server runs it:
  - the background daemon (`lasso start`), if its pidfile is live; otherwise
  - on Linux, any **systemd service whose main process is this binary**. A user
    unit gets `systemctl --user restart`; a system unit gets `systemctl restart`
    as root, else `sudo -n systemctl restart`, and if that can't run it prints
    the exact command to type. A unit whose main process is something else (a
    wrapper script that starts lasso among other things) is left alone, since
    restarting it would bounce everything it runs.

  `lasso update --no-restart` swaps the binary and restarts nothing. When
  lasso is already up to date, `lasso update` still restarts any systemd-run
  lasso left on a replaced binary by an earlier update.
- A **systemd-supervised source checkout** (the maintainer's prod) keeps the
  historical behavior: `git pull --ff-only` then `systemctl --user restart lasso`,
  which rebuilds from source.

The Settings tab surfaces "update available → vX.Y.Z" when a newer release exists.

## Exposing it

The left pane is a **writable shell** (and `/mcp` is unauthenticated), so never
bind to `0.0.0.0` — on a VPS that's the public internet. Two safe ways to reach
it off-box:

### Over a Cloudflare tunnel (recommended)

Keep lasso on loopback and let a tunnel reach it, so no port is ever exposed:

```bash
lasso start -listen 127.0.0.1:8090
```

Point a [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
tunnel's ingress at `http://127.0.0.1:8090` and gate the hostname with
**Cloudflare Access** (or equivalent) — that authentication is what guards the
writable shell, the MCP endpoint and the shared browser's `/cdp` and `/browser-mcp`. A loopback
bind needs no `-insecure-no-auth`.
Because the tunnel serves **HTTPS**, the browser runs in a secure context, so
Files-tab downloads work (see the caveat below).

### Behind Cloudflare Access (fleet boxes)

On a box where Access already fronts the hostname, lasso can require the edge's
identity itself — the same contract the workspace image's ttyd front door uses
(`--auth-header Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`):

```bash
lasso start -listen 0.0.0.0:8090 \
  -require-access-header \
  -access-allowed-emails you@example.com,ops@example.com \
  -disable-self-update
```

| flag | env | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-require-access-header` | `LASSO_REQUIRE_ACCESS_HEADER=1` | Every request without a non-empty `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header gets **403** — `/api/*`, `/mcp`, `/cdp`, `/browser-mcp`, `/terminal/`, `/shell/`, their websocket upgrades, `/api/file*`, the OAuth endpoints and the SPA alike. Evaluated **before** UI_AUTH and the MCP OAuth check. (lasso's own chrome-devtools-mcp processes reach `/cdp` over loopback on an internal token, ahead of this gate.) |
| `-access-allowed-emails` | `LASSO_ACCESS_ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated allowlist. When set, only those identities pass (case-insensitive); when empty, any identity Access vouched for passes. |
| `-disable-self-update` | `LASSO_DISABLE_SELF_UPDATE=1` | Turns off the in-app self-update (`git pull` + `systemctl --user restart` via `systemd-run --user`). On a fleet box an agent must not be able to move its own front door: `POST /api/self-update` returns 403 and the UI hides the action. |

With `-require-access-header` set, a **non-loopback bind is allowed without
`UI_AUTH`** — the edge identity *is* the auth — and startup logs an `access:`
line naming which gates are live.

> **Only safe behind an edge that strips client-supplied `Cf-Access-*`
> headers.** Cloudflare does that for a hostname it protects (it drops the
> client's copy and re-adds its own after verifying the JWT). Behind a bare port
> or a proxy that forwards client headers verbatim, anyone can satisfy the gate
> with `curl -H`. That's why the header is **never** trusted unless the flag is
> set: with the flag off, nothing in lasso reads it.

### Over your tailnet

Bind to your tailscale interface; only your tailnet can reach it, and WireGuard
already encrypts and authenticates it:

```bash
lasso start -listen "$(tailscale ip -4):8090" -insecure-no-auth
```

For a login on top, set `UI_AUTH=user:pass` in the environment (never argv) and
drop `-insecure-no-auth`. The server **refuses** a non-loopback bind unless one of
those is set, so it can't accidentally expose a bare shell. Then reach it from any
tailnet device at `http://<host>:8090/` (MagicDNS, e.g. `http://citadel:8090/`).

> **Downloads need a secure context.** The Files tab downloads via a synthetic
> `<a download>`, which browsers only honor on **localhost** or over **HTTPS**.
> Over plain-HTTP tailnet access (`http://citadel:8090`) a download silently
> won't fire — use the Cloudflare tunnel (HTTPS) if you need to pull files off
> the box. (Viewing files still works; only the download action is gated.)
>
> **Push notifications need one too** — and they need it harder: the Push API
> doesn't exist at all on a plain-HTTP origin. `tailscale serve` gives your node
> a real HTTPS origin and makes both work without Cloudflare; see
> [Notifications](#notifications-ios-home-screen).

> **The Browser tab's Iframe mode embeds only what your browser can embed.** A
> bare port (`5173`) resolves to `http://<the hostname you're using>:5173`, so
> it frames straight from your browser with nothing in between. Over an HTTPS
> origin (behind a tunnel) that's mixed content and the tab says so — open it
> in a new tab, reach lasso over plain HTTP on the tailnet, or use **Agent**
> mode, which has no such limit (there a bare port means `localhost` on
> lasso's machine).

Note `/api/file` reads any absolute path as the running user, and `/mcp`,
`/cdp` and `/browser-mcp` (the [shared browser](#shared-browser)) are open — fine on a private
tailnet or behind Access, but confine them before widening access.

## Notifications (iOS home screen)

lasso pushes a notification to your phone for two things: an agent that
**blocks** — stops mid-task waiting on a tool approval, a plan gate, a "y/n" —
which it watches every reachable host for in the background, and an agent that
**asks for you deliberately**:

```bash
lasso notify "the migration drops 2 columns — safe to run on prod?"
```

That's the `notify` MCP tool behind a CLI, so an agent with only a terminal and
one with lasso's MCP server configured both get the same behavior: titled with
the calling agent's name (resolved from `$HERDR_PANE_ID`), opening on its host,
and **non-zero exit / `sent:false` when no device is registered** — so an agent
never reports pinging you when nothing was delivered. Both arrive with no tab
open and the screen off.

It rides [Web Push](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8291), which on iOS
only works for a site added to the **Home Screen** (iOS 16.4+). Once:

1. Reach lasso over **HTTPS** — either the Cloudflare tunnel above or a
   `tailscale serve` origin (see below). **Plain HTTP will not work at all**,
   including over your tailnet.
2. Open it in Safari → Share sheet → **Add to Home Screen**.
3. Launch it from the Home Screen icon, open **Settings**, and tick *"Push
   notifications to this device"*. iOS asks for permission; allow it.
4. **Send a test notification** confirms the whole path end to end.

### HTTPS is not optional — and `http://<host>:8090` over the tailnet isn't it

Service workers and the Push API are **secure-context only**: browsers expose
them on `https://` and on loopback (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`), and nowhere else.
Reached at a plain-HTTP tailnet address, Safari doesn't merely refuse permission
— `navigator.serviceWorker` and `PushManager` are simply absent, and lasso's
Settings tab says *"This browser can't do Web Push"*. A tailnet is private, but
privacy isn't what the rule tests.

**Tailscale can give you real HTTPS**, so a tailnet-only lasso can do push
without Cloudflare in front. Enable MagicDNS + HTTPS certificates in the
tailnet admin panel, then let `tailscale serve` terminate TLS for lasso's
loopback port:

```bash
lasso start -listen 127.0.0.1:8090                        # stays on loopback
tailscale serve --bg --https=8090 http://127.0.0.1:8090    # -> https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8090
```

That origin is a genuine Let's Encrypt-backed `https://` (the cert is issued to
your node's MagicDNS name), which is all the browser and Apple's push service
need — the VAPID JWT lasso signs names the origin you subscribed from, and an
`https://…ts.net` origin satisfies Apple where a bare hostname does not. Add
*that* URL to your Home Screen and enable notifications from it.

Three things to know about the tailnet route:

- **A push subscription belongs to an ORIGIN.** The `ts.net` app and a
  Cloudflare-hostname app are two different installs, so enabling notifications
  in both registers the same phone twice and you get every notification twice.
  Pick one origin per device.
- **Notifications still arrive off the tailnet.** They come from Apple, not from
  lasso, and the service worker renders them entirely from the payload — it
  never calls back to the origin. Only *opening* one needs the tailnet up, since
  that loads the app.
- **`tailscale serve` exposes lasso to every device on your tailnet**, with no
  Access gate in front of the writable terminal, `/mcp`, `/cdp` or `/browser-mcp`. Set
  `UI_AUTH=user:pass` if the tailnet isn't a trust boundary you're happy with.
  Turn it back off with
  `tailscale serve --https=8090 off`.

Each device registers itself, and every registered device gets every
notification; Settings lists them with the outcome of the last push, so a device
that has quietly stopped working says so. Turning the tick off removes that
device. Nothing is polled at all while no device is registered.

The push payload is encrypted end to end — Apple relays a blob it cannot read —
and the VAPID keypair identifying this server is generated once into
`~/.lasso/lasso.db`. Set `LASSO_PUSH_CONTACT=mailto:you@example.com` if you'd
rather your push provider saw an address than lasso's own hostname; by default
the JWT names the origin you subscribed from.

## On a phone

Added to the Home Screen as above, lasso is a usable phone app: it launches from
the icon lasso ships, full screen, on whatever origin you installed. Everything
works over plain HTTP on the tailnet too, except the same secure-context
features push needs — Files-tab downloads won't fire and a terminal copy falls
back to a legacy clipboard write — so the HTTPS origin is worth having for more
than notifications. Uploads and dictation don't care either way. It's a
home-screen shortcut, not an offline PWA: the phone is a client for the box, so
the box has to be up.

A terminal on a touch screen is missing a keyboard, a mouse, and a right button,
so those live in a **radial dial** — the ⌘ button in the terminal's bottom-right
corner, which only mounts on a touch device. Hold it and slide to a target, or
tap to open the ring and tap one:

- **Common keys** — Esc, ^C, Tab, ⇧⇥, ↵ and the arrows, none of which the iOS
  keyboard offers.
- **Input** — a plain text field to compose in, so autocorrect and the keyboard's
  dictation microphone work (neither does inside xterm). **Insert** types the
  buffer into the pane, **Enter** types and submits it, and **Attach** takes a
  photo or any file from Photo Library / Take Photo / Files, uploads it to the
  host the focused pane runs on, and inserts its path — which is how you hand a
  screenshot or a log to the agent in that pane.
- **New** — the New Agent dialog. **Lasso** — pane search, host switcher, sidebar.

In the terminal itself, **drag to scroll** (the drag becomes wheel events, so it
works in tmux's alternate screen and in TUIs that grab the mouse) and
**long-press for right-click** (herdr's own menu). When the socket drops while
the phone sleeps, the overlay reads **Tap to Reconnect** — a tap anywhere in the
terminal brings it back.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by CI on a version tag:

```bash
mise run bump patch --commit     # bump lassoSemver in src/version.go and commit
git tag "v$(grep -oP 'lassoSemver = "\K[^"]+' src/version.go)"
git push origin main --tags
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` then builds the frontend, cross-compiles the
binaries (linux/darwin × amd64/arm64) with the tag stamped in, and publishes a
GitHub Release with the binaries, `checksums.txt`, and `install.sh`. The tag must
match `lassoSemver` (the workflow enforces it).

## The logo

The icon is the Execution Associates **EXA monogram**, white on the brand's
ink (`#1B0A2C`), from the brand site at design.execution.associates. The source
is `docs/icon/icon.png`, used at every size down to the 16px browser tab. The
wordmark is `docs/brand/lasso-wordmark.png`, a generated raster in the brand's
Sunset Neon look.
Regenerate the favicon, ICO and home-screen assets in `src/web/public/`:

```bash
mise run icons
```

Icon URLs are versioned in `src/web/index.html` and
`src/web/public/manifest.json` to invalidate cached art; bump the `?v=` when
the art changes.

## Dogfooding

To run lasso from *inside* a herdr session (e.g. building lasso with itself), its
embedded terminal would otherwise refuse to nest. Set `allow_nested = true` under
`[experimental]` in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` to allow it.
